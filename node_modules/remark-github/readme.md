Auto-link references to commits, issues, pull-requests, and users like
GitHub: [Writing on GitHub][writing-on-github].

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install remark-github
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown

-   Commit: f8083175fe890cbf14f41d0a06e7aa35d4989587
-   Commit (fork): foo@f8083175fe890cbf14f41d0a06e7aa35d4989587
-   Commit (repo): wooorm/remark@e1aa9f6c02de18b9459b7d269712bcb50183ce89
-   Issue or PR (`#`): #1
-   Issue or PR (`GH-`): GH-1
-   Issue or PR (fork): foo#1
-   Issue or PR (project): wooorm/remark#1
-   Mention: @wooorm

Some links:

-   Commit: https://github.com/wooorm/remark/commit/e1aa9f6c02de18b9459b7d269712bcb50183ce89
-   Commit comment: https://github.com/wooorm/remark/commit/ac63bc3abacf14cf08ca5e2d8f1f8e88a7b9015c#commitcomment-16372693
-   Issue or PR: https://github.com/wooorm/remark/issues/182
-   Issue or PR comment: https://github.com/wooorm/remark-github/issues/3#issue-151160339
-   Mention: @ben-eb
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
var vfile = require('to-vfile');
var remark = require('remark');
var github = require('remark-github');

remark()
  .use(github)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function (err, file) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(String(file));
  });
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

###### Repository

These links are generated relative to a project.  In Node this is
auto-detected by loading `package.json` and looking for a `repository`
field.  In the browser, or when overwriting this, you can pass a
`repository` in `options`.

###### Mentions

By default, mentions are wrapped in `strong` nodes (which render to
`<strong>` in HTML), to simulate the look of mentions on GitHub.
However, this creates different HTML markup, as the GitHub site applies
these styles using CSS.  Pass `mentionStrong: false` to turn off this
behaviour.
